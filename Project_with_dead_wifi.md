# :rocket: Projects with dead Wi-Fi router
- **Practice Hardware Hacking via UART:** Open the case and look for a cluster of 3 or 4 pins (Tx, Rx, GND). You can connect a USB-to-TTL serial adapter to these pins to access the router's bootloader and root console. It is fantastic practice for exploring device security and reverse engineering.
 - **Flash Custom Firmware (OpenWrt/DD-WRT):** If you can get it on the network, flash it with open-source firmware. You can use it as a lightweight sandbox to run Python automation scripts, cron jobs, or manage local network processes without tying up your main PC.
 - **Set Up a Honeypot:** Isolate the router on a secure VLAN and set it up as a dummy target on your network. You can practice monitoring network traffic, analyzing packet captures, or safely testing out network vulnerability scanners against it.
 - **DIY Print or File Server:** If the router has a working USB port, you can plug in an old printer or a flash drive and configure it to serve files or print jobs to your local network.
If the Board is Completely Dead (Salvaging Parts)
If the main SoC (System on a Chip) is fried, it is time to harvest the hardware.
 - **Extract the Firmware (EEPROM):** Locate the flash memory chip (usually an 8-pin SOIC chip). You can practice desoldering it from the board, hook it up to an EEPROM programmer (like a CH341A), and attempt to dump the binary file to analyze its file system and look for hardcoded credentials.
 - **Repurpose the Antennas:** Wi-Fi antennas use standard IPEX/U.FL connectors. You can easily snap them off the board and reuse them to boost the range of custom IoT projects, ESP32 boards, or Software Defined Radio (SDR) setups for capturing wireless signals.
 - **Scavenge the Heatsinks:** The CPU and Wi-Fi chips usually have small ceramic or aluminum heatsinks. Carefully pry them off and clean the thermal paste. They are perfect for cooling down a Raspberry Pi or other small microcontrollers if you are pushing their hardware performance.
 - **Keep the Power Supply:** The wall adapter is usually a reliable 9V or 12V DC power supply. Keep it in your parts bin; it is incredibly useful for powering custom desktop gadgets, LED strips, or motor controllers.
 - **Desoldering Practice:** If you want to get better at soldering, a dead motherboard is a risk-free practice zone. Practice safely removing capacitors, LEDs, voltage regulators, and tactile buttons without lifting the copper pads.
